            <h3 class="title">Artificial Intelligence And The Future</h3>
            <p class="text">What exactly is Artificial Intelligence? It is basically the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially computer programs.


                The ability to invent intelligent machines has fascinated humans since the ancient times. Researchers are creating systems and programs that could mimic human thoughts and try doing things that human could do. The artificial Intelligence is a combination of computer science, physiology and philosophy.
                
                The Artificial Intelligence has come a long way from the old days. It was with the invention of the computers that the Artificial Intelligence method began to maneuver researchers. The technology was finally available and seemed to stimulate intelligent behavior. Intelligent here means, things which could be done at a faster pace and thinking than a human mind. The insights and theory brought about the Artificial Intelligence will set a trend in the future. The current products are just the beginning of the future trend.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Can a Soulless Machine Feel?</h3>
            <p class="text">Computers will soon be able to simulate the functioning of a human brain. In a near future, artificial superintelligence could become vastly more intellectually capable and versatile than humans. But could machines ever truly experience the whole range of human feelings and emotions, or are there technical limitations?
            In theory, any neural process can be reproduced digitally in a computer, even though the brain is mostly analog. This is hardly a concern, as Ray Kurzweil explained in his book How to Create a Mind. However it does not always make sense to try to replicate everything a human being feel in a machine.
            While sensory feelings like heat, cold or pain could easily be felt from the environment if the machine is equipped with the appropriate sensors, this is not the case for other physiological feelings like thirst, hunger, and sleepiness. These feelings alert us of the state of our body and are normally triggered by hormones such as vasopressin, ghrelin, or melatonin. Since machines do not have a digestive system nor hormones, it would be downright nonsensical to try to emulate such feelings.An intelligent computer could also prompt some emotions based on its own thought processes, just like the joy or satisfaction experienced by solving a mathematical problem. In fact, as long as it is allowed to communicate with the outside world, there is no major obstacle to computers feeling true emotions of its own like joy, sadness, surprise, disappointment, fear, anger, or resentment, among others. These are all emotions that can be produced by interactions through language (e.g. reading, online chatting) with no need for physiological feedback.

            <h3 class="title">Chatbots and How Smart They Are.</h3>
            <p class="text">One of the popularly known and used concepts of AI is smart chatbots. Chatbots are built to serve the customers by answering their queries efficiently and in real-time without needing a human from the business side. The chatbots can be used to reply via texting or using audio to answer the questions efficiently. It reduces the burden of answering customer queries around the clock.It works by analyzing the available training data sets, and according to the outputs received, an appropriate response is generated for users. Working proficiency of these chatbots has significantly increased, and it has become almost difficult to distinguish between human response or boat response. High standards of chatbots benefit businesses also.
            Most of the industries are benefiting by using technology by their side, and on-demand businesses are the ones that top this particular chart by increasing their reach quickly. As the competition is becoming fierce with every passing day, companies must introduce something unique in the business that distinguishes them from others.</p>
